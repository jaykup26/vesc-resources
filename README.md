A list of devices, projects, add-ons and hardware that run or work with the VESC Project

## Displays
#### Davega X - A UART based display that can display all VESC telemetry in real time including range estimates & BMS data
#### Davega OS - The original Davega which had open source firmware
#### Roxie - A fork of the Davega OS with open source hardware and firmware

## Loggers - Apps using generic NRF52832/NRF52840 modules
#### VESC tool mobile saves logs as .csv which can be loaded into the VESC tool desktop.
#### Yours Truly is a free app and logs with any bluetooth adapter.  Only works on iOS and sharing/viewing other people's logs is the main limitation
#### I think the Stormcore app is also iOS only
